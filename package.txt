To create the project's WAR file, run the following command from the project's root directory:

$ mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true clean install

The resulting WAR file can be found in the project's 'target' directory. The
above command will also download all the necessary dependencies (i.e., jar files).

Under <root-dir>/src/main, you'll find a 'webapp' directory. That's the directory
that marks this project as a JEE web application project and tells the above 
command to create the WAR file and it corresponding directory hierarchy in the 
'target' directory. 

The WAR file that is created, serves only as a template. It will need to be 
extracted at some other location, its configuration files (i.e., xml files)
updated and/or added, then re-archived using the jar tool. The resulting
WAR file will most probably also need to be renamed.
