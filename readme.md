Metis is a lightweight, server-side framework that is used for quickly defining, implementing, and deploying Web application programming interfaces (APIs) that follow the REST architectural style. These Metis-based APIs are used by HTTP client applications to create, read, update, and delete entities that reside in their respective data store. Metis provides a very simple remote data access solution that allows a data store to quickly embrace the Web without the need to develop any server-side code.
