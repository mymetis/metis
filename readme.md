Metis is a lightweight server-side framework that is used for quickly defining, implementing, and deploying Web application programming interfaces (APIs) that follow the REST architectural style. A Metis-based Web API is used by HTTP client applications to create, read, update, and delete entities that reside in their respective data store. Metis provides a simple remote data access solution that allows a data store to quickly embrace the Web without the need to develop any server-side code.    

Metis APIs provide remote data access to any number of different data stores. For example, an API can provide access to a database being hosted by the MySQL database management system (DBMS) and at the same time, also provide access to a database being hosted by the PostgreSQL DBMS. Metis provides access to any data store that has a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver. There are many data stores, besides DBMSs, that have JDBC drivers; these are some examples: Google Spreadsheet, Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet, QuickBooks, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Twitter, Intuit Data Services, Facebook, and Dynamics CRM.
